You are probably wondering why I have chosen to write this script in Bash. The reason is very simple; I wanted a script with the minimum number of dependencies possible. To get this script up-and-running you _technically_ only need the `temp.sh` file, and the `config` file. If you don't have a certain dependency (i.e. git or procps) you can just remove the code that uses them.

The current version of the script is **version 17**.

This script is currently set up for Celsius. However, it can easily be modified for other temperature scales.

If you need any help configuring my script or don't know how to make it start automatically check the [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) file.

## Features
- by default it has a slightly aggressive fan curve profile (lower temps, louder noise)
- uses `nvidia-settings` commands
- automatically enables/disables GPU fan control (but **not** `CoolBits`)
- easy to read code, with plentiful comments (beginner friendly)
- "intelligently" adjusts the time between tempurature readings
- very lightweight
- supports multiple GPU control
- makes use of a config file with explanations for each setting

## Prerequisites
- `bash` version 4 and above, or a bash-like shell with the same syntax (others untested)
- `nvidia glx driver` version greater than 304
- `nvidia-settings` for controlling the GPU(s)
- `coreutils` for printf, etc.
- `procps` - you can comment out the function `check_already_running` if you don't have it

## How to install
### GitHub
- Download the .zip file straight from the GitHubs
- Extract it somewhere, and open a terminal to that directory
- Make sure `CoolBits` is enabled (see [USAGE.md](USAGE.md))
- Run `bash temp.sh` (or any compatable shell) or `./temp.sh` for a foreground process. Run with the option `-D` (case sensitive) for a background process (i.e. `./temp.sh -D`).

### git
- Choose a folder you want to download/install the script in
- `git clone https://github.com/nan0s7/nfancurve`
- Follow the last two steps under the **GitHub** guide area

### Arch Linux
There are unofficial AUR packages maintained by [@Scrumplex](https://github.com/Scrumplex).
- Stable: [nfancurve](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nfancurve/)<sup>AUR</sup>
- Git Master: [nfancurve-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nfancurve-git/)<sup>AUR</sup>

- [@xberg](https://github.com/xberg), for finding and fixing a bug with the multi-GPU side of the script

## TODO
- ~~make sure that "CoolBits" is enabled~~ - _not really the scope of this script_
- ~~possibly check the currently installed driver version~~ - _earlier versions used the  GPUCurrentFanSpeed command_
- add in a **really** detailed guide of how the script works
- add nouveau support (once they fix Pascal)
- add AMD support?
- make fans controllable without needing to use the `nvidia-settings` app (for headless support)
- add support for GPU's that have more than one controllable fan (i.e. >1 fan controller)
- make it completely POSIX compliant
